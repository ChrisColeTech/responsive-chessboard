# Splash Screen Research

## Overview

This document presents comprehensive research findings on modern splash screen design standards for 2024-2025. The research focuses on replacing outdated patterns (like spinners) with modern UX approaches.

**APPLICATION NAME**: **Master Chess Training** - This is the official application name that should be used consistently across all splash screens and branding elements.

## Research Findings

### Industry Standards for 2024-2025

**Key Findings from UX Research:**

1. **Timing Guidelines:**

   - Under 1 second: No loading animation (distracting)
   - 1-10 seconds: Skeleton screens or subtle looped indicators
   - Over 10 seconds: Progress bars with percentage feedback

2. **Spinner Death:**

   - Loading spinners are "UX killers" in 2025
   - Give no progress feedback, cause anxiety
   - Users cannot tell if system is working or frozen
   - Particularly bad for waits longer than 10 seconds

3. **Modern Alternatives (React Spring Implementation):**
   - **Skeleton Screens**: `useTransition` for skeleton-to-content morphing
   - **Interactive Splash**: `useSpring` with gesture event integration
   - **Physics-Based Animation**: Spring configs with tension/friction for natural motion
   - **Progressive Content**: `useChain` for orchestrated content revelation
   - **Branded Splash**: `useSpring` for logo entrance with elegant timing

### 2024 React Implementation Trends

**Higher-Order Component (HOC) Pattern**: The recommended approach for React splash screens is defining them as HOCs that wrap the entire app, showing splash content during initialization and hiding when loading completes.

**React 19 Integration**: New hooks like `useActionState` and `useOptimistic` provide elegant solutions for handling loading states and optimistic UI updates.

**Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Modern libraries like React Spring and Framer Motion work seamlessly across web and React Native.

**Performance First**: Hardware acceleration, 60fps animations, and minimal re-renders are standard expectations.

## Modern UX Best Practices

### ✅ DO:

- **Keep it under 2-3 seconds maximum**
- **Use brand colors and consistent visual identity**
- **Show actual loading progress when possible**
- **Use skeleton screens for content loading**
- **Design for mobile-first responsiveness**
- **Test across screen sizes and accessibility**
- **Make subtle animations, not attention-grabbing**
- **Give immediate feedback that app is working**

### ❌ DON'T:

- **Use spinning indicators**
- **Force artificial delays to show splash longer**
- **Show black screen (users think app is broken)**
- **Use looped animations for operations >10 seconds**
- **Make animations that delay actual app functionality**
- **Ignore accessibility (contrast, reduced motion)**
- **Create flashy distracting animations**
- **Leave users guessing if system is working**

## React Spring Animation Patterns for Splash Screens

Since the project already uses React Spring, here are the key animation patterns for creating elegant splash screen effects:

### 🌸 **Core React Spring Hooks**

```typescript
// Already installed in project
import {
  useSpring,
  useTrail,
  useTransition,
  useChain,
} from "@react-spring/web";
```

### **useSpring** - Individual Element Animation

- **Best for**: Single element entrances, hover effects, physics-based motion
- **Pattern**: `{ from: {...}, to: {...}, config: { tension, friction } }`
- **Chess Use**: King piece entrance with natural spring physics

### **useTrail** - Staggered Sequence Animation

- **Best for**: Multiple elements appearing in sequence with consistent timing
- **Pattern**: Array of items with automatically staggered delays
- **Chess Use**: Chess pieces appearing one after another in formation

### **useTransition** - Enter/Exit State Changes

- **Best for**: Conditional rendering, skeleton-to-content transitions
- **Pattern**: `{ items, from, enter, leave }` with smooth state changes
- **Chess Use**: Skeleton board morphing into actual game pieces

### **useChain** - Complex Orchestrated Sequences

- **Best for**: Multi-stage animations where timing relationships matter
- **Pattern**: Multiple animation refs chained together with precise timing
- **Chess Use**: Logo → Title → Pieces → Board in carefully timed sequence

### **Performance Benefits**

- **No re-renders**: Animations run outside React render cycle
- **Hardware acceleration**: Automatic GPU acceleration for transform/opacity
- **Interruption handling**: Smooth transitions even when interrupted
- **Cross-platform**: Same code works for web and React Native
