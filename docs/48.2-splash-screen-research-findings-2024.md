## Core UX Principles

### Primary Purpose
A splash screen serves as the **initial visual encounter** users have with an application, setting the tone for their entire experience. This brief moment of interaction is crucial; it not only captures attention but also provides a glimpse into the brand's identity and values.

### Functional Integration
The perfect splash screen hides away a few key functionalities that your app should have, both from a user experience perspective and a functionality one. Modern splash screens should:

- **Hide loading processes** while maintaining user engagement
- **Provide immediate brand recognition** without complex information processing
- **Set visual expectations** for the application's design language
- **Offer seamless transitions** into the main application experience

### Brand Identity Focus
Splash screens give UI designers the chance to make a **bold first impression** and reinforce brand identity. Such screens usually feature:

- Brand logo and name
- Background with specific brand colors or images  
- Consistent visual language with the main application
- Professional, polished presentation

## Critical Timing Guidelines

### The 3-Second Rule
**Splash screens should not last for more than 3 seconds.** If your splash screen lasts longer than 3 seconds, it will frustrate regular app users and take away from the user experience.

### The 1-Second Rule  
If you expect users to use your app regularly (at least once a day, like messenger apps) then use the **1-second rule or eliminate it altogether**.

### User Tolerance Research
- **50 milliseconds**: Time it takes for users to decide whether to stay or leave
- **3-5 seconds**: Practical maximum duration for most applications
- **6 seconds**: Point where user attention significantly drops off
- **10 seconds**: Jakob Nielsen's classic limit - too long for modern expectations

### Context-Based Duration
- **First-time users**: Can handle slightly longer durations (up to 3 seconds)
- **Returning users**: Should be 1 second maximum or skippable
- **Frequent users**: Consider eliminating splash screens entirely

## React Spring Implementation

### Installation
```bash
npm install @react-spring/web
```

**Current Status (December 2024):**
- Version: 10.0.1
- React Support: 16.8+, 17, 18 (React 19 support in progress)
- Active maintenance with 935+ projects using it

### Basic Implementation Pattern
```javascript
import { useSpring, animated } from '@react-spring/web'

const SplashScreen = () => {
  const fadeIn = useSpring({
    from: { opacity: 0 },
    to: { opacity: 1 },
    config: { duration: 1000 }
  })
  
  return (
    <animated.div style={fadeIn}>
      {/* Splash content */}
    </animated.div>
  )
}
```

### Recommended Animation Patterns

**Simple Fade In:**
```javascript
const styles = useSpring({
  from: { opacity: "0" },
  to: { opacity: "1" },
  config: { duration: "1500" }
})
```

**Subtle Movement:**
```javascript
const styles = useSpring({
  from: { opacity: 0, transform: "translateY(20px)" },
  to: { opacity: 1, transform: "translateY(0px)" },
  config: { duration: 1200 }
})
```

### Performance Benefits
- **No re-renders**: Animations run outside React render cycle
- **Hardware acceleration**: Automatic GPU acceleration for transform/opacity
- **Smooth interruption handling**: Graceful transitions when interrupted
- **Imperative API**: Run animations without React rendering overhead

## 2024 Design Trends

### Dark Mode Integration
The look is **elegant, stylish, and modern**. As users spend more time with devices, dark mode plays a vital role in user experience. Anything that sits on black looks more elegant.

### Neumorphism for Sophistication  
Neumorphism combines flat design and skeuomorphism using background colors, shapes, gradients, and shadows. Neuromorphic UIs are elegant with soft elements that feel comfortable.

### Seamless Transitions
Advanced implementations integrate splash screens seamlessly into the rest of the user experience. The strategy is to design the background so it can **merge effortlessly** with the first screen of your app.

### Error Handling Integration
Instead of separate error screens, integrate errors into the splash screen itself with refresh buttons, maintaining professional appearance while prompting user action.

## Accessibility & Inclusive Design

### WCAG 2025 Compliance Requirements

**WCAG 2.2 Standards**: WCAG 2.2 became the W3C Recommendation standard by 2025, adding new requirements including **Focus Appearance** and ensuring all actions can be completed without drag gestures.

**Pause, Stop, Hide Criterion**: WCAG provides specific recommendations for animated content, requiring controls for non-essential moving, blinking, or scrolling elements that:
- Start automatically  
- Last more than 5 seconds
- Are part of other page elements

### Reduced Motion Implementation

**Critical Implementation**: The `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS media feature detects if a user has enabled a setting to minimize non-essential motion. This is **mandatory** for accessible splash screens.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .splash-animation {
    animation: none;
    transition: none;
  }
}
```

**React Spring Integration**:
```javascript
const prefersReducedMotion = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches

const animation = useSpring({
  opacity: prefersReducedMotion ? 1 : springs.opacity,
  transform: prefersReducedMotion ? 'none' : springs.transform,
  config: prefersReducedMotion ? { duration: 0 } : config.default
})
```

### Screen Reader Considerations

**Critical Issues**:
- Animations that change content dynamically can **confuse screen reader technology**
- Unexpected animations can cause **misinterpretation** of vocalized content
- Motion shouldn't hide or add elements where screen readers cannot find them

**Best Practices**:
- Include elements in a way screen readers can access them without pulling them out of context
- Provide `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates
- Use semantic HTML structure even in splash screens

### Legal & Compliance Requirements

**2024 Statistics**: Over **4,500 digital accessibility lawsuits** were filed in the U.S. in 2024, with increased government scrutiny expected in 2025.

**Implementation Requirements**:
1. Always respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
2. Provide pause/stop controls for splash screen animations  
3. Ensure splash screens don't interfere with screen reader navigation
4. Keep animations under 1 second for accessibility compliance
5. Avoid flashing content that could trigger seizures
6. Test with actual assistive technologies and users with disabilities

## Performance Optimization

### Bundle Splitting & Code Splitting

**2024 Performance Impact**: Recent HTTP Archive studies show:
- **22% increase** in median JavaScript bundle size for desktop (464 KB)
- **25% increase** for mobile web pages (444 KB)
- **53% of mobile visits** abandoned if page takes longer than 3 seconds

**React Code Splitting for Splash Screens**:
```javascript
// Lazy load main app after splash
const App = React.lazy(() => import('./App'))

const SplashWrapper = () => {
  const [showApp, setShowApp] = useState(false)
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => setShowApp(true), 2000)
    return () => clearTimeout(timer)
  }, [])
  
  if (showApp) {
    return (
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <App />
      </Suspense>
    )
  }
  
  return <SplashScreen />
}
```

### Memory Management

**Critical Considerations**:
- Clean up animations and event listeners after splash screen transitions
- Avoid memory leaks during splash-to-app transitions
- Use proper cleanup patterns with React hooks

```javascript
const useSplashCleanup = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      // Cleanup animations, timers, event listeners
      cancelAnimationFrame(animationId)
      clearTimeout(timerId)
    }
  }, [])
}
```

### Core Web Vitals Impact

**Performance Metrics**:
- **Lazy loading improves FCP** (First Contentful Paint) by reducing initial bundle size
- **Proper implementation reduces TTI** (Time to Interactive)
- **Bundle splitting improves LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint)
- **Strategic loading reduces CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift)

**Measurement Tools**:
- Use `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to visualize bundle composition
- Lighthouse audits for performance, accessibility, and best practices
- Google reports **1.11% increase in conversion** for every 100ms decrease in load speed

## Mobile vs Desktop Considerations

### Device Performance Optimization

**Mobile-Specific Challenges**:
- Slower processors require lighter animations
- Limited memory demands efficient cleanup
- Touch interfaces need larger interaction targets
- Network constraints affect loading strategies

**Performance Differences**:
- Initial bundle sizes can decrease by **up to 60%** after implementing mobile-specific code splitting
- Route-based code splitting works best for mobile with distinct navigation patterns
- Dynamic resource loading particularly beneficial for slower mobile connections

### Responsive Animation Strategies

**Device-Aware Animations**:
```javascript
const isMobile = window.innerWidth <= 768
const animationConfig = isMobile 
  ? { duration: 800, easing: 'ease-out' }
  : { tension: 280, friction: 60 }

const springs = useSpring({
  opacity: 1,
  config: animationConfig
})
```

**Touch vs Mouse Interactions**:
- Mobile: Focus on tap targets, swipe gestures
- Desktop: Hover states, keyboard navigation
- Consider different interaction patterns for splash screen controls

### Network Considerations

**Connection-Aware Loading**:
```javascript
const connection = navigator.connection || navigator.mozConnection || navigator.webkitConnection
const isSlowConnection = connection && connection.effectiveType.includes('2g')

const splashDuration = isSlowConnection ? 3000 : 1500
```

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing Splash Screens

**Jest Mock Setup**:
```javascript
// jest/setup.js
jest.mock("react-spring", () => ({
  useSpring: jest.fn(() => ({ opacity: 1 })),
  animated: {
    div: 'div'
  }
}))
```

**Component Testing**:
```javascript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import SplashScreen from './SplashScreen'

test('renders splash screen with logo', () => {
  render(<SplashScreen />)
  expect(screen.getByRole('img', { name: /logo/i })).toBeInTheDocument()
})

test('respects reduced motion preference', () => {
  Object.defineProperty(window, 'matchMedia', {
    value: jest.fn(() => ({ matches: true }))
  })
  
  render(<SplashScreen />)
  // Assert no animations are present
})
```

### Integration Testing

**React Testing Library Best Practices**:
```javascript
import { render, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react'

test('splash screen transitions to main app', async () => {
  render(<App />)
  
  expect(screen.getByTestId('splash')).toBeVisible()
  
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(screen.getByTestId('main-app')).toBeVisible()
  }, { timeout: 3000 })
  
  expect(screen.queryByTestId('splash')).not.toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

### End-to-End Testing

**Detox Integration Testing**:
```javascript
describe('Splash Screen', () => {
  it('should show login screen after splash', async () => {
    await expect(element(by.id('splash'))).toBeVisible()
    await waitFor(element(by.id('login')))
      .toBeVisible()
      .withTimeout(2000)
    await expect(element(by.id('login'))).toBeVisible()
  })
})
```

### Testing Environment Requirements

**Critical Guidelines**:
- **Test on release builds**, not development environments
- Avoid testing with Expo Go (interferes with splash screen rendering)
- Test across different device models and screen sizes
- Verify behavior with reduced motion settings enabled
- Test timeout scenarios and error states

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Timeout Management

**Animation Timeout Handling**:
```javascript
const useSplashTimeout = (maxDuration = 5000) => {
  const [timedOut, setTimedOut] = useState(false)
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setTimedOut(true)
    }, maxDuration)
    
    return () => clearTimeout(timer)
  }, [maxDuration])
  
  return timedOut
}
```

### Network Error Recovery

**Connection Error Patterns**:
```javascript
const SplashScreen = () => {
  const [error, setError] = useState(null)
  const [retryCount, setRetryCount] = useState(0)
  
  const handleRetry = useCallback(() => {
    setError(null)
    setRetryCount(prev => prev + 1)
    // Retry initialization logic
  }, [])
  
  if (error) {
    return (
      <div className="splash-error">
        <p>Failed to load. Please try again.</p>
        <button onClick={handleRetry}>
          Retry ({retryCount}/3)
        </button>
      </div>
    )
  }
  
  return <SplashContent />
}
```

### Progressive Enhancement

**JavaScript Failure Handling**:
```html
<!-- Provide non-JS fallback -->
<noscript>
  <div class="splash-fallback">
    <h1>App Name</h1>
    <p>Please enable JavaScript to continue</p>
  </div>
</noscript>
```

**Graceful Degradation Strategy**:
- Provide static splash content as fallback
- Ensure core branding visible without animations
- Include skip mechanism for accessibility
- Implement retry logic for failed network requests

### Error State Integration

**Best Practices**:
- Integrate error messages within splash screen context
- Maintain visual consistency even in error states
- Provide clear action buttons (refresh, retry, skip)
- Log errors for monitoring while preserving user experience
- Implement exponential backoff for retry attempts

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

## Research Findings: Visual Design & Creative Excellence

**Implementation Note**: While the research below discusses specific colors and design choices from successful brands, actual implementation should prioritize using existing application theme variables (e.g., Tailwind CSS theme colors) to ensure splash screens respond appropriately to theme changes and maintain consistency with the overall application design system.

### **Question 1: What visual design principles make splash screens instantly captivating in the first 50ms?**

**The 50ms Psychology Rule**: Research shows that first impressions can be formed in as little as **50 milliseconds** when users view a page or interface. This extremely short timeframe is used in screen-timeout testing to assess how people perceive the aesthetics of a site.

**Key Principles for Instant Impact**:
- **High-contrast color schemes** - ensure your logo/image assets pop off the screen
- **Centered focal points** - place primary visual elements in the field of view center
- **High-resolution, detailed assets** - crisp visuals create immediate quality perception
- **Solid colors or gradients that command attention** without overwhelming

**Critical Statistic**: **48% of visitors** say that a website's design is the most crucial factor in deciding the brand's credibility. The splash screen shapes their first impression of your brand within milliseconds.

### **Question 2: How do you create emotional impact and set user expectations through splash screen design?**

**Emotional Connection Strategy**: Beyond branding, splash screens are now designed to **engage and intrigue users**. Whether through captivating animations, enticing imagery, or brief but impactful messages, they aim to create a positive emotional response and anticipation for what's to come.

**Setting User Expectations**:
- Use **captivating visuals, brand colors, and smooth animations** for seamless transitions
- Create **positive initial impression** making users more likely to engage further
- Establish **visual continuity** between splash and main application interface
- Generate **anticipation and excitement** for the app experience ahead

**Design Impact**: A carefully crafted visual can **captivate the user's attention**, creating a positive and memorable introduction to the app that sets expectations for quality and professionalism.

### **Question 3: What composition techniques work best for splash screens?**

**Visual Design Fundamentals**: The principles of **scale, visual hierarchy, balance, contrast, and Gestalt** not only create beautiful designs, but also increase usability when applied correctly.

**Composition Best Practices**:
- **Centered focal point** - primary logo or symbol in visual center
- **Minimal elements** - avoid cluttering the limited screen time
- **High contrast** - ensure visual elements stand out clearly
- **Balanced proportions** - use appropriate scaling for different screen sizes
- **Clear visual hierarchy** - guide the eye to most important elements first

### **Question 4: What animation timing, easing functions, and choreography create the most engaging experiences?**

**Duration Guidelines for 2024**:
- **Small components/buttons**: 100-200ms
- **Page transitions**: 500-700ms  
- **Complex sequences (2-5 objects)**: 300-400ms
- **Large sequences (6-10 objects)**: 500-700ms
- **Movement rule**: 100ms for every 10% movement of viewport

**Easing Functions for Natural Motion**:
- **Linear easing**: Constant speed - use only for rotations, feels unnatural otherwise
- **Ease-in**: Start slow, speed up - good for entrances from offscreen
- **Ease-out**: Start fast, slow down - best for settling into final position
- **Ease-in-out**: Slow-fast-slow - most natural for complete movements

**Choreography Principles**:
- **Staggering**: Delay animation starts with short offsets (50-100ms) between elements
- **Sequencing**: Arrange movements in logical order to guide user attention
- **Depth creation**: Use slight delays to show element relationships and independence

### **Question 5: How do you choreograph multiple visual elements into a cohesive sequence?**

**Systematic Choreography Approach**:
- **Define duration tokens** - create consistent timing scales (t1: 100ms, t2: 200ms, t3: 500ms, etc.)
- **Layer animations** - background → logo → text → interactive elements
- **Use delays strategically** - create visual understanding that elements are independent but related
- **Maintain overall duration** - keep total sequence under 2-3 seconds maximum

**Staggering Best Practices**:
- **Soften entry of large sets** with progressive delays
- **Shift user gaze** in intended direction through sequenced reveals
- **Create depth perception** with overlapping but offset animations
- **Avoid overwhelming** by using subtle timing differences

### **Question 6: How do you create visual rhythm and pacing that feels natural?**

**Natural Movement Principles**:
- **Organic easing** - avoid rigid, uniform motion that feels mechanical
- **Anticipation and follow-through** - elements should ease into final positions
- **Proper acceleration curves** - match real-world physics expectations
- **Consistent timing relationships** - maintain proportional speeds across elements

**Rhythm Creation**:
- **Establish beat patterns** with consistent interval spacing
- **Vary intensity** - not all elements need same animation strength
- **Build crescendo** - start subtle, build to focal point, then settle
- **Respect user attention** - don't compete with too many simultaneous movements

### **Question 7: How do successful brands use color psychology in splash screens?**

**Spotify's Green Strategy**: Spotify's vibrant green embodies **musical exploration and growth**, fueling creative discovery. Green is associated with **growth, vitality, and freshness** - qualities aligning with discovering new music. It also reflects **harmony and balance**, matching Spotify's seamless listening experience goal.

**Airbnb's Coral Approach**: Airbnb uses **soft coral and shady white** evoking feelings of **warmth, friendliness, and hospitality**. This aligns with making users feel at home anywhere. The color is **inviting and approachable** without the aggressive energy of bright red, representing **belonging anywhere**.

**Color Psychology Principles**:
- **Blue**: Conveys trust and security
- **Red**: Creates urgency and excitement  
- **Green**: Suggests growth, harmony, freshness
- **Coral/Orange**: Warmth, friendliness, approachability
- **Black**: Premium, sophisticated, elegant

### **Question 8: What typography treatments make splash screens feel premium?**

**Luxury Typography Characteristics**:
- **Refined proportions** with careful spacing
- **Thoughtful contrast** between thick and thin elements
- **Professional kerning** - precise letter spacing
- **Consistent weights** throughout character set
- **Subtle details** that mass-market fonts lack

**Premium Font Categories**:
- **Custom typefaces** - unique to brand identity
- **Modified classics** - Didot, Baskerville variations
- **High-contrast serifs** - for sophisticated, elegant feel
- **Clean sans-serifs** - for modern, minimal luxury

**Typography Animation Impact**:
- **Kinetic text makes messages memorable** and provokes emotions
- **Shows brand personality** effectively
- **Enhances viewer retention** and engagement
- **Creates lasting impressions** beyond static text

### **Question 9: How do you express brand personality through motion design in 2-3 seconds?**

**Brand Expression Strategy**:
- **Logo integration** - incorporate brand symbol into animation sequence
- **Color consistency** - use established brand palette throughout
- **Movement style** - match animation personality to brand character (playful vs. serious)
- **Timing rhythm** - fast/energetic for dynamic brands, slow/elegant for luxury brands

**Personality Translation**:
- **Luxury brands**: Slow, elegant ease-out animations, minimal elements, premium typography
- **Tech brands**: Quick, precise movements, geometric shapes, modern aesthetics  
- **Creative brands**: Playful bounces, varied timing, expressive color transitions
- **Financial brands**: Steady, reliable timing, conservative color choices, trust-building elements

### **Question 10: What are effective visual hooks and attention-grabbing techniques?**

**Attention-Grabbing Strategies**:
- **High contrast color schemes** - make elements impossible to ignore
- **Unexpected animation directions** - elements entering from surprising angles
- **Scale transformations** - dramatic size changes create visual interest
- **Reveal techniques** - progressive disclosure of brand elements
- **Particle effects** - subtle environmental animations

**Visual Hook Implementation**:
- **Focal point magnetism** - use contrast and positioning to draw eye immediately
- **Progressive revelation** - don't show everything at once, build curiosity
- **Brand symbol prominence** - make logo/symbol hero element of composition
- **Color temperature contrast** - warm elements against cool backgrounds (or vice versa)

### **Question 11: How do you create anticipation and excitement during loading?**

**Anticipation Building Techniques**:
- **Progressive disclosure** - reveal brand elements in meaningful sequence
- **Building energy** - start subtle, crescendo to brand reveal, then settle
- **Interactive feedback** - subtle responses to device orientation or touch
- **Layered reveals** - background → primary element → supporting text → call to action

**Excitement Creation**:
- **Micro-interactions** - small delightful details users discover
- **Surprising moments** - unexpected but delightful animation behaviors  
- **Sensory engagement** - use haptic feedback where appropriate
- **Emotional connection** - animations that reflect human movement patterns

### **Question 12: What micro-interactions elevate splash screens from functional to delightful?**

**Delightful Details**:
- **Breathing animations** - subtle scale/opacity pulses suggesting life
- **Particle systems** - environmental effects that add richness
- **Parallax layers** - depth through differential motion speeds
- **Hover states** - responsive elements even during brief display
- **Physics-based bounces** - satisfying settle animations

**Micro-Interaction Categories**:
- **Feedback animations** - confirm system is working properly
- **Attention direction** - guide user focus to important elements
- **Brand personality** - small details that express character
- **Anticipation builders** - create excitement for main app experience

### **Question 13: Examples of captivating splash screens from successful apps**

**Airbnb's Minimalist Excellence**: Airbnb keeps things **light with nothing but its logo** on screen. This minimalist approach allows their carefully chosen **coral color to create immediate emotional connection** without overwhelming users.

**Spotify's Contrast Mastery**: Spotify's **iconic green-and-black color scheme** creates a **high-contrast palette** that allows easy navigation and enhances user experience. The design uses **color for practical and aesthetic purposes**, with different hues corresponding to features and content categories.

**Booking.com's Background Impact**: Makes an impact with its **strategic background color usage** while maintaining focus on core branding elements.

**Key Success Patterns**:
- **Logo prominence** without competitive elements
- **Strategic color usage** aligned with brand psychology
- **Minimal visual complexity** for instant recognition
- **Consistent brand language** from splash through main app

### **Question 14: Balancing visual impact with performance and accessibility**

**Performance Optimization**:
- **Hardware acceleration** - use transform and opacity for smooth animations
- **Efficient asset delivery** - optimize image sizes and formats
- **Animation cleanup** - properly dispose of resources after transitions
- **Memory management** - avoid leaks during splash-to-app transitions

**Accessibility Integration**:
- **Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`** - provide static alternatives
- **High contrast options** - ensure visibility across user needs
- **Screen reader compatibility** - maintain semantic structure
- **Timing flexibility** - provide skip options for users who need them

**Balance Strategies**:
- **Progressive enhancement** - start with accessible base, add visual flair
- **Performance budgets** - define maximum animation complexity limits
- **Device awareness** - adjust visual complexity based on device capabilities
- **Fallback planning** - ensure graceful degradation when resources are limited

## Implementation: Splash Screen Class System

### **Context-Aware Splash Container System**

The splash screen system supports two distinct display contexts through CSS class variants:

#### **Core Container Structure**

```css
.splash-container {
  min-height: 100vh;
  width: 100vw;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  background: hsl(var(--background));
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

#### **In-App Variant** (`splash-in-app`)
```css
.splash-container.splash-in-app {
  min-height: 100vh;
  width: 100%;
  padding: 0;
}
```

**Purpose**: Displays splash screen within the application's tab system
- **Width**: `100%` (fits within app layout)
- **Position**: `relative` (normal document flow)
- **Context**: Used when splash is viewed as a regular app page
- **Navigation**: Accessible via app tabs

#### **Modal Variant** (`splash-modal`)
```css
.splash-container.splash-modal {
  min-height: 100vh;
  width: 100vw;
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  padding: 0;
  z-index: 50;
  background: var(--background, #ffffff);
}
```

**Purpose**: Full viewport takeover for immersive splash experience
- **Width**: `100vw` (full viewport width)
- **Position**: `fixed` (overlay on top of everything)
- **Z-index**: `50` (above all other content)
- **Context**: Used when splash is triggered as fullscreen modal

### **Splash Modal State Management System**

#### **App Store Integration**

```typescript
interface AppState {
  splashModalOpen: boolean;
  splashModalPage: string | null;
}

// Modal control actions
openSplashModal: (page: string) => void;
closeSplashModal: () => void;
```

#### **Modal Trigger Flow**

1. **User Action**: Clicks "Toggle Fullscreen" in action sheet
2. **State Update**: `openSplashModal('minimalsplash')` called
3. **Store Change**: `splashModalOpen: true, splashModalPage: 'minimalsplash'`
4. **Modal Render**: `SplashModal` component detects state change
5. **Component Render**: Renders splash component with `variant="modal"`

#### **Modal Component Structure**

```typescript
// SplashModal.tsx
const SplashModal: React.FC = () => {
  const splashModalOpen = useAppStore((state) => state.splashModalOpen);
  const splashModalPage = useAppStore((state) => state.splashModalPage);
  const closeSplashModal = useAppStore((state) => state.closeSplashModal);

  if (!splashModalOpen || !splashModalPage) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div className="fixed inset-0 z-[9999] flex items-center justify-center">
      {/* Backdrop with blur and click-to-close */}
      <div
        className="absolute inset-0 bg-black/80 backdrop-blur-sm"
        onClick={closeSplashModal}
      />

      {/* Modal content with close button */}
      <div className="relative w-full h-full max-w-none">
        <button className="absolute top-6 right-6 z-10" onClick={closeSplashModal}>
          <X className="w-6 h-6" />
        </button>
        {/* Splash component renders here with variant="modal" */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### **Component Implementation Pattern**

#### **Variant Prop Interface**
```typescript
interface SplashPageProps {
  variant?: 'in-app' | 'modal';
}

const SplashPage: React.FC<SplashPageProps> = ({ variant = 'in-app' }) => {
  const containerClass = variant === 'modal' 
    ? 'splash-container splash-modal splash-fade-in'
    : 'splash-container splash-in-app splash-fade-in';

  return (
    <div className={containerClass}>
      <div className="splash-center-content">
        {/* Splash content */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### **CSS Class Hierarchy**

#### **Layout Classes**
- **`splash-container`**: Base full-screen container
- **`splash-in-app`**: In-app variant modifier  
- **`splash-modal`**: Modal variant modifier
- **`splash-center-content`**: Content centering with -20vh offset

#### **Animation Classes**
- **`splash-fade-in`**: 0.6s entrance animation with translateY
- **`crown-glow`**: Glowing text shadow animation for premium elements
- **`modern-dots`**: Loading indicator dots with staggered pulse

#### **Typography Classes**
- **`splash-title`**: 2.5rem responsive title styling
- **`splash-subtitle`**: 1.25rem secondary text styling

### **Usage Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: In-App Navigation**
```typescript
// User navigates to splash tab
// Component renders with default variant
<MinimalSplashPage />
// Uses splash-in-app classes
// Fits within app layout
```

#### **Scenario 2: Fullscreen Modal**
```typescript
// User clicks "Toggle Fullscreen" action
// State: { splashModalOpen: true, splashModalPage: 'minimalsplash' }
// Modal renders with explicit variant
<MinimalSplashPage variant="modal" />
// Uses splash-modal classes
// Full viewport takeover
```

### **Key Benefits of This System**

1. **Context Awareness**: Same component adapts to different display contexts
2. **Layout Safety**: No overflow or positioning issues in either mode
3. **State Management**: Clean separation between display and state logic
4. **User Control**: Users can view splash screens both ways
5. **Theme Integration**: All variants respect theme variables and switching
6. **Performance**: No duplicate components, just CSS class switching

## Implementation: Page-Aware Actions System

### **Hooks-Based Page Context Management**

The splash screens integrate with a sophisticated page-aware actions system that provides contextual functionality based on the current page.

#### **usePageActions Hook**
```typescript
// Automatically sets current child page for action sheet context
export const usePageActions = (pageId: string) => {
  const setCurrentChildPage = useAppStore((state) => state.setCurrentChildPage)
  
  useEffect(() => {
    setCurrentChildPage(pageId)  // Set active page context
    
    return () => {
      setCurrentChildPage(null)  // Cleanup on unmount
    }
  }, [pageId, setCurrentChildPage])
}
```

#### **usePageInstructions Hook**
```typescript
// Automatically loads instructions from centralized service
export const usePageInstructions = (pageId: string) => {
  const { setInstructions } = useInstructions()

  useEffect(() => {
    const pageInstructions = instructionsService.getInstructions(pageId)
    if (pageInstructions) {
      setInstructions(pageInstructions.title, [...pageInstructions.instructions])
    }
  }, [pageId, setInstructions])
}
```

### **Action Sheet Integration Pattern**

Each splash screen follows this consistent integration pattern:

```typescript
// Component wrapper pattern
export const MinimalSplashPageWrapper: React.FC = () => {
  usePageInstructions('minimalsplash')  // Load page-specific instructions
  usePageActions('minimalsplash')       // Set action context
  
  return <MinimalSplashPage />
}
```

#### **ActionSheetContainer Mapping**
```typescript
// Dynamic action mapping based on current page
const actionMap: Record<string, Record<string, Fn>> = {
  minimalsplash: {
    'test-minimal-load': minimalSplashActions.testMinimalLoad,
    'restart-animation': minimalSplashActions.restartAnimation,
    'toggle-fullscreen': minimalSplashActions.toggleFullscreen,
    'go-to-animated': minimalSplashActions.goToAnimated,
    'go-to-progress': minimalSplashActions.goToProgress,
    'go-to-branded': minimalSplashActions.goToBranded
  },
  // ... other page mappings
}
```

## Implementation: Animation Restart System

### **Animation Key Pattern**

Every splash screen hook implements a restart mechanism using an animation key pattern:

```typescript
export function useMinimalSplashActions() {
  const [animationKey, setAnimationKey] = useState(0)
  
  const restartAnimation = useCallback(() => {
    setAnimationKey(prev => prev + 1)  // Increment forces re-render
    setProgress(0)                     // Reset any progress state
    setStatus('Initializing...')       // Reset status messages
  }, [])
  
  return {
    restartAnimation,
    animationKey,
    // ... other actions
  }
}
```

#### **Component Integration**
```typescript
// Animation key forces component re-mount, restarting CSS animations
<div key={animationKey} className="splash-fade-in">
  {/* Content re-mounts with fresh animations */}
</div>

// Effect dependencies include animationKey to restart sequences
useEffect(() => {
  // Animation sequence logic
}, [animationKey, chessPieces])
```

### **Progressive Animation Sequences**

Splash screens use sophisticated timing sequences that can be restarted:

```typescript
// Staggered animation timing with cleanup
useEffect(() => {
  const timeouts: NodeJS.Timeout[] = []
  
  chessPieces.forEach((piece, index) => {
    const delay = 800 + (index * 500) // Staggered timing
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      // Animation logic
    }, delay)
    timeouts.push(timeout)
  })
  
  return () => {
    timeouts.forEach(clearTimeout)  // Proper cleanup
  }
}, [animationKey, chessPieces])
```

## Implementation: Critical Design Rules & Constraints

### **🚫 Explicit Design Prohibitions**

#### **1. Bottom UI Placement Rule**
**NEVER place any elements in the bottom third of splash screens**

- **Rationale**: Mobile safe areas, tab bars, and action sheets occupy bottom space
- **Violation Example**: Progress bars at page bottom
- **Correct Approach**: Integrate progress into central design elements
- **Reference**: `splash-center-content` uses `-20vh` margin for proper centering

#### **2. No Audio in Splash Screens**
**Audio is EXPLICITLY prohibited in splash screen animations**

- **Rationale**: Splash screens should be subtle and non-intrusive
- **Implementation**: `testMinimalLoad` callback is empty - no audio calls
- **Exception**: Action button clicks may have UI sound feedback
- **Reference**: Action handlers use `playUIClick()` for user-initiated actions only

#### **3. No Spinning Animations**
**Spinning loaders and spinners are forbidden**

- **Rationale**: Research shows spinners are "UX killers" in 2024-2025
- **Alternative**: Subtle pulse, fade, or progress indicators
- **Implementation**: Use `animate-pulse`, `animate-card-entrance`, not rotational animations
- **Reference**: Modern best practices favor skeleton screens over spinners

#### **4. No False Credentials**
**Never include unauthorized certifications or institutional claims**

- **Violation Example**: "FIDE Approved", "International Chess Federation Recognized"  
- **Correct Approach**: "Premium Training", "Excellence in Chess Education"
- **Legal Risk**: False credential claims create liability issues
- **Reference**: Documented in lessons learned sections

### **✅ Required Design Standards**

#### **1. Theme Variable Compliance**
All colors MUST use CSS custom properties:
```css
background: var(--background);
color: var(--foreground); 
border-color: var(--border);
```

#### **2. Centered Focal Point**
All splash screens must have a clear visual center:
- Use `splash-center-content` class
- Single primary focal element (chess piece, logo)
- Support element hierarchy below focal point

#### **3. Timing Constraints**
- **Maximum Duration**: 3 seconds total animation time
- **Entrance Animation**: 0.6s for `splash-fade-in`
- **Stagger Delays**: 200-500ms between elements
- **Restart Capability**: All animations must support restart via animation key

#### **4. Accessibility Requirements**
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .splash-animation {
    animation: none;
    transition: none;
  }
}
```

### **🔧 Implementation Enforcement**

These rules are enforced through:

1. **CSS Architecture**: `splash-center-content` prevents bottom placement
2. **Hook Patterns**: Animation restart mechanism is standardized
3. **Action Integration**: No direct audio calls in splash components
4. **Theme System**: All colors go through CSS custom properties
5. **Code Review**: Lessons learned documentation prevents repeated violations
