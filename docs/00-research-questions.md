# Research Questions for Responsive React Chessboard Component

## Project Overview
We are creating a modern, elegant, and responsive React chessboard component that will be published as an NPM package. The component will feature customizable piece sets via props and include an example project for demonstration.

## Research Questions

### 1. Component Architecture & Structure
- How should we structure the component hierarchy (Board → Square → Piece)?
- What's the optimal way to represent the board state (8x8 array, FEN notation, or object-based)?
- Should we use React.memo() for performance optimization of individual squares?

### 2. Responsive Design & Layout
- What CSS approach should we use for responsiveness (CSS Grid, Flexbox, or CSS-in-JS)?
- How do we ensure the board maintains perfect square proportions across all screen sizes?
- What are the best practices for mobile touch interactions vs desktop mouse interactions?

### 3. Piece Set Management
- How should we structure the piece set prop interface for maximum flexibility?
- Should piece sets be loaded dynamically or bundled with the component?
- What's the best way to handle the knight orientation variants (left/right facing)?

### 4. Performance Considerations
- How do we optimize SVG rendering for 64+ pieces simultaneously?
- Should we implement virtual scrolling or other performance optimizations for mobile?
- What's the impact of React re-renders when pieces move, and how can we minimize it?

### 5. Accessibility & User Experience
- What ARIA labels and roles should we implement for screen readers?
- How do we support keyboard navigation for chess piece movement?
- What visual feedback should we provide for valid moves, check, and checkmate states?

### 6. Animation & Visual Effects
- Should we implement smooth piece movement animations, and if so, using CSS or JavaScript?
- How do we handle drag-and-drop interactions with proper visual feedback?
- What hover effects and highlighting patterns enhance user experience without being distracting?

### 7. API Design & Props Interface
- What props should be exposed for customization (colors, sizes, piece sets, board orientation)?
- How do we handle move validation - should it be built-in or left to the parent component?
- What callback functions should we provide (onMove, onSquareClick, onPieceSelect)?

### 8. State Management
- Should the component be controlled, uncontrolled, or support both patterns?
- How do we handle complex chess states like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion?
- What's the best way to integrate with chess engines or game logic libraries?

### 9. Bundle Size & Dependencies
- How do we minimize the package size while including multiple piece sets?
- Should we have peer dependencies on React, or bundle everything?
- What's the optimal way to handle SVG assets in the build process?

### 10. Testing Strategy
- How do we test responsive behavior across different screen sizes programmatically?
- What unit tests are needed for piece positioning and move validation?
- How do we test accessibility features and keyboard navigation?

### 11. Documentation & Examples
- What example use cases should we demonstrate (basic board, game replay, puzzle mode)?
- How do we document the piece set format for users who want custom pieces?
- What integration examples should we provide for popular chess libraries?

### 12. Browser Compatibility & Fallbacks
- What's the minimum browser support we should target?
- How do we handle SVG rendering issues in older browsers?
- Should we provide fallback images or simplified rendering for low-performance devices?

## Critical Issues from Previous Implementation

### 13. Drag and Drop Failures
- Why does drag and drop functionality break, and what are the common root causes?
- How do we properly implement HTML5 drag and drop API vs custom mouse/touch event handling?
- What are the differences between drag behavior on desktop vs mobile, and how do we handle both?
- How do we maintain drag state during React re-renders without losing the drag operation?
- What event handling patterns prevent drag events from being interrupted or cancelled?

### 14. Piece Shuffling During Game Updates
- How do we prevent pieces from visually "jumping" or shuffling when the board state updates?
- What causes React keys to change during moves, leading to component remounting?
- How do we implement stable, consistent piece identification across board updates?
- Should we use position-based keys, piece-based keys, or a hybrid approach?
- How do we handle animations during state transitions to prevent visual glitches?

### 15. Board Rerendering Issues
- What triggers unnecessary full board re-renders when only one piece moves?
- How do we implement granular updates that only re-render affected squares?
- What React patterns (useMemo, useCallback, React.memo) prevent cascade re-renders?
- How do we separate board layout from piece positioning to minimize render scope?
- What state structure minimizes the number of components that need to update?

### 16. Responsive Auto-Resizing Problems
- How do we implement smooth board resizing without layout thrashing?
- What CSS techniques ensure the board maintains aspect ratio during parent container changes?
- How do we handle ResizeObserver API for dynamic container size changes?
- What causes "flicker" or "jump" during resize operations, and how do we prevent it?
- How do we debounce resize events to prevent excessive re-calculations?

### 17. Animation System Failures
- What causes animations to be interrupted or skipped during state updates?
- How do we coordinate piece movement animations with React state changes?
- Should we use CSS transitions, CSS animations, or JavaScript-based animation libraries?
- How do we handle conflicting animations (multiple pieces moving simultaneously)?
- What patterns ensure animations complete before allowing new interactions?

### 18. FEN Update Synchronization Issues
- How do we properly synchronize FEN string updates with visual board state?
- What causes desynchronization between FEN notation and displayed pieces?
- How do we handle partial FEN updates vs complete board replacement?
- What validation is needed to ensure FEN strings don't break the visual state?
- How do we implement two-way binding between FEN props and internal board state?
- Should FEN updates trigger animations, or should they be instant snapshots?

## Next Steps
After reviewing these questions, we'll prioritize research areas focusing on the critical issues first, then begin investigating solutions for each major concern before starting implementation.
