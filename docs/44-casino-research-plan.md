## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive research needed to transform the visual slot machine mockup into a fully functional casino gaming experience, with potential expansion to additional games like blackjack and poker.

## Core Slot Machine Functionality Research

### 1. Spinning Animations & Visual Effects
**Research Questions:**
- What are the optimal timing patterns for mobile slot game spinning (spin duration, reel stagger timing for touch devices)?
- How do popular mobile slot games implement smooth touch-responsive spinning animations?
- What CSS animation techniques and React libraries provide 60fps mobile slot spinning without battery drain?
- How do successful mobile slot games create engaging "near miss" effects on small screens?
- What animation patterns work best for mobile slot games to maintain engagement without causing motion sickness on small screens?

**Research Answers:**
- **Optimal Timing**: Mobile slot games typically use 2-3 second spin durations with 200-300ms stagger delays between reels stopping. This creates authentic casino feel while being fast enough for mobile gaming.
- **Touch-Responsive Animations**: Modern mobile slots use CSS transforms and React Spring for smooth animations. Key is using `transform: translateY()` instead of changing `top` position for hardware acceleration.
- **60fps Techniques**: React Spring with `useSpring` hook provides reactive approach that only updates when necessary, minimizing re-renders. CSS `will-change: transform` property enables hardware acceleration for spinning reels.
- **Near Miss Effects**: Implement by having reels briefly "hesitate" before final position using React Spring's spring physics. Visual cue with subtle shake or glow effect when winning symbol is one position away.
- **Motion Sickness Prevention**: Use easing functions (`ease-out` curves), limit simultaneous movement to 3 reels max, and provide "reduce motion" accessibility option that uses instant transitions instead of spinning.

### 2. Symbol Randomization & RNG Systems
**Research Questions:**
- How do popular mobile slot games implement fair and engaging random number generation?
- What weighted symbol distribution models work best for mobile slot games to balance fun and fairness?
- How do successful mobile slot games create engaging randomness while preventing obviously predictable patterns?
- What JavaScript/React patterns work best for implementing testable and debuggable slot game randomization?
- How do mobile slot games create the illusion of streaks and patterns while maintaining true randomness?

**Research Answers:**
- **Fair RNG Implementation**: Use Web Crypto API `crypto.getRandomValues()` for cryptographically secure randomness instead of `Math.random()`. Implement PRNG with seed values for testing/debugging while maintaining unpredictable patterns in production.
- **Weighted Distribution**: Use probability arrays where rare symbols (Kings, Queens) have 5-8% weight, common symbols (Pawns) have 15-20% weight. Implementation: `const weightedRandom = (weights) => { /* cumulative distribution sampling */ }`
- **Engaging Randomness**: Implement "near miss" logic where 15-20% of losing spins place winning symbols one position away. Avoid obvious patterns by ensuring no symbol appears in same position >3 consecutive times.
- **JavaScript Patterns**: Create `SlotRNG` class with methods like `generateSpin()`, `calculateWin()`, and `getSymbolWeights()`. Use Jest for unit testing with deterministic seeds. Store RNG state in Zustand for debugging.
- **Streak Illusions**: Track recent outcomes in sliding window, slightly increase/decrease symbol weights (Â±2-3%) based on recent frequency to create natural-feeling variance while maintaining mathematical fairness.

### 3. Win Detection & Payout Systems
**Research Questions:**
- What payline patterns work best for mobile slot games (single line vs multi-line on small screens)?
- How do popular mobile slot games implement satisfying win detection with visual feedback on touch devices?
- What payout multiplier ranges create engaging gameplay for mobile slot games with virtual currency?
- How do mobile slot games implement bonus rounds and special features that work well on smartphones?
- What reward structures keep mobile slot game players engaged without real money gambling mechanics?

**Research Answers:**
- **Payline Patterns**: Single center line works best for 3-reel mobile slots due to screen space. For 5-reel games, use 9-25 paylines with clear visual indicators. Implement as arrays: `const centerLine = [1, 1, 1]` representing row positions.
- **Visual Feedback**: Winning combinations should highlight with glowing borders, animate winning symbols with scale/rotate effects, and use haptic feedback (300ms vibration). Implement winning line animation from left to right over 1-2 seconds.
- **Payout Multipliers**: Engaging ranges are 2x-5x for common wins, 10x-25x for rare combinations, 50x-200x for jackpots. Chess themed: Pawn=2x, Rook=5x, Knight=8x, Bishop=10x, Queen=25x, King=100x.
- **Mobile Bonus Rounds**: Simple tap-to-reveal bonuses work best on touch devices. "Pick 3 pieces" bonus where player taps chess pieces to reveal coin amounts. Avoid complex mini-games that require precision on small screens.
- **Engagement Without Real Money**: Daily coin bonuses (500-1000), achievement systems ("Win 100 spins"), leaderboards with virtual rankings, and progressive virtual jackpots that reset weekly maintain engagement.

### 4. Balance Management & Betting Logic
**Research Questions:**
- How do mobile slot games handle balance updates and state persistence when apps are backgrounded or closed?
- What React state management patterns work best for preventing race conditions in mobile slot game betting?
- How do mobile games implement betting controls that work well with touch interfaces and prevent accidental taps?
- What are the best UX patterns for handling insufficient balance scenarios in mobile slot games?
- How do mobile slot games implement auto-spin features with accessible stop controls for touch devices?

**Research Answers:**
- **State Persistence**: Use Zustand with persistence middleware to localStorage. Update balance immediately after spin completion, not during spin. Implement debounced saves (500ms delay) to prevent excessive writes during rapid interactions.
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Use `useCallback` and `useState` with functional updates. Lock spin button during active spin with `isSpinning` state. Pattern: `setBalance(prev => prev - wager)` ensures atomic updates.
- **Touch-Friendly Betting**: Implement +/- buttons with 500ms hold-to-repeat functionality. Minimum 44x44px touch targets (iOS HIG). Add visual feedback (scale animation) on tap. Prevent accidental max bets with confirmation modal for bets >50% of balance.
- **Insufficient Balance UX**: Show "Get More Coins" button with daily bonus option. Gracefully reduce bet to maximum affordable amount with notification: "Bet reduced to [amount] coins". Never allow negative balances.
- **Auto-Spin Controls**: Large, prominent STOP button (60x60px minimum) that's always visible during auto-spin. Implement with React Spring for smooth start/stop animations. Allow stopping mid-spin to complete current spin then halt.

### 5. Audio Systems & Feedback
**Research Questions:**
- What sound effects create engaging mobile slot game experiences without draining battery or being intrusive?
- How do mobile slot games layer audio to work well with device speakers, headphones, and silent mode?
- What web audio formats and compression work best for mobile slot games with fast loading times?
- How do mobile slot games implement haptic feedback (vibration) to enhance the spinning and winning experience?
- What accessibility patterns work best for mobile slot games (visual indicators for audio, volume controls)?

**Research Answers:**
- **Battery-Efficient Audio**: Use short sound clips (0.5-2 seconds max), preload essential sounds only, and implement audio pooling to reuse audio instances. Avoid background music loops; use ambient sounds triggered by user actions.
- **Device Audio Compatibility**: Detect silent mode with `AudioContext.state`, provide visual feedback when audio is muted. Use compressed audio (64kbps MP3) for mobile data efficiency. Layer: ambient (20%), effects (80%) volume mix.
- **Optimal Web Audio Formats**: MP3 for broad compatibility, OGG Vorbis as fallback. Keep files under 50KB each. Use Web Audio API for precise timing and volume control: `audioContext.decodeAudioData()`.
- **Haptic Implementation**: Use Vibration API: `navigator.vibrate([200])` for wins, `[100, 50, 100]` patterns for big wins. Respect user's vibration settings and provide toggle in settings. Battery consideration: limit to max 500ms per interaction.
- **Accessibility Patterns**: Visual waveform indicators during sound playback, captions for audio cues ("Coins dropping", "Big win!"), and high contrast mode for sound controls. Implement screen reader compatibility with ARIA labels.
