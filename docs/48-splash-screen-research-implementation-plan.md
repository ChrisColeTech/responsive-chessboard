- **Animation**: Gentle fade-in sequence, no distracting movement
- **Color Palette**: Monochromatic with theme primary as accent
- **Duration**: 1.5-2 seconds maximum

**Naming Rationale:**
"Minimal" emphasizes restraint and professionalism - qualities essential in chess mastery. This design says "serious training begins now."

**Technical Elements:**
```typescript
// Single gentle fade-in
const fadeSpring = useSpring({
  from: { opacity: 0, transform: 'translateY(10px)' },
  to: { opacity: 1, transform: 'translateY(0px)' }
})

// Minimal linear progress
const progressSpring = useSpring({
  from: { width: '0%' },
  to: { width: '100%' },
  config: { duration: 1800 }
})
```

**Elements to Add:**

  delay: index * 300,
  config: { tension: 260, friction: 20 }
}))

// Piece counter
const { counter } = useSpring({
  counter: pieceCount,
  from: { counter: 0 }
})
```

  - "Preparing analysis tools..."
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear information architecture
- **Progress Timing**: Realistic loading simulation (not just cosmetic)
- **Duration**: 2-4 seconds with authentic progress feel

**Naming Rationale:**
"Loading Progress" emphasizes transparency and user feedback - critical for professional applications.

**Technical Elements:**
```typescript
// Multi-stage progress system
const mainProgress = useSpring({
  progress: currentStage.percentage,
  config: { tension: 300, friction: 40 }
})

// Message transitions

## Technical Architecture

### React Spring Integration

**Core Animation Patterns:**
```typescript
// Standard entrance animation
const entranceSpring = useSpring({
  from: { opacity: 0, transform: 'translateY(20px) scale(0.95)' },
  to: { opacity: 1, transform: 'translateY(0px) scale(1)' },
  config: { tension: 280, friction: 60 }
})

// Progress bar animation  
const progressSpring = useSpring({
  width: `${progress}%`,
  config: { tension: 300, friction: 30 }
})

// Counter animation
const { counter } = useSpring({
  counter: targetValue,
  from: { counter: 0 }
})
```

### CSS Integration

**Existing Classes to Leverage:**
- **Animations**: `@keyframes float`, `drift`, `pulse-glow`, `card-entrance`
- **Components**: `.card-gaming`, `.btn-gaming-primary`, `.glass`
- **Background**: `.bg-orb-*`, `.bg-sparkle-*`, `.chess-piece-color-*`
- **Typography**: `.text-gaming-gradient`, `.text-primary-gradient`
- **Gradients**: `.bg-gaming-gradient`, `.bg-theme-primary`

**New Classes Needed:**
```css
.splash-container {
  @apply min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center relative overflow-hidden;
}

.splash-progress-container {
  @apply w-full max-w-md h-2 bg-muted rounded-full overflow-hidden;
}

.splash-progress-bar {
  @apply h-full bg-primary rounded-full transition-all duration-300;
}

.splash-counter {
  @apply font-mono text-4xl font-bold text-gaming-gradient;
}
```

### Component Architecture

**Base Component Pattern:**
```typescript
interface SplashPageProps {
  onComplete?: () => void
  duration?: number
  showSkip?: boolean
}

export const SplashPageBase: React.FC<SplashPageProps> = ({
  onComplete,
  duration = 2000,
  showSkip = true
}) => {
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0)
  
  // Auto-complete after duration
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      onComplete?.()
    }, duration)
    return () => clearTimeout(timer)
  }, [duration, onComplete])
  
  return (
    <div className="splash-container bg-background">
      {/* Page-specific content */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Lessons Learned

### From Research Phase

**Industry Standards Evolution:**
- **Spinner Death**: Traditional spinners are completely obsolete in 2025
- **Progress Transparency**: Users expect real loading feedback, not fake progress
- **Brand Moments**: Splash screens are premium brand interaction opportunities
- **Physics Matter**: React Spring's physics-based animations feel natural vs. CSS timing functions

### From Implementation Phase

**Navigation Architecture:**
- **Store Integration Critical**: Never bypass Zustand with global variables or hacks
- **Tab Clearing Logic**: Parent tabs must clear child pages for consistent UX
- **Action Sheet Context**: Child pages need dedicated action mappings for proper functionality
- **Wrapper Pattern**: Context switching requires wrapper components, not inline logic

**React Spring Insights:**
- **useSpring vs useSprings**: Use `useSprings` for coordinated multi-element animations
- **Config Tuning**: `{ tension: 280, friction: 60 }` provides natural, professional motion
- **Counter Animations**: `.to()` method essential for smooth numerical displays
- **Cleanup Important**: Always cleanup timers and subscriptions to prevent memory leaks

**CSS Architecture Discoveries:**
- **Existing Keyframes Gold**: The app's `@keyframes float` and `drift` are perfect for chess pieces
- **Theme Integration**: `color-mix()` with CSS variables provides seamless theme compatibility
- **Animation Delays**: Staggered entrances using `animation-delay-*` classes create professional sequences
- **GPU Acceleration**: Existing `.gpu-accelerated` class should be used for all animated elements

**Performance Optimizations:**
- **Transform Only**: Only animate `transform` and `opacity` properties for 60fps
- **Will-Change**: Use sparingly and remove after animations complete  
- **Batch Updates**: React Spring's batch API prevents multiple re-renders
- **Reduced Motion**: Must support `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`

### Common Pitfalls Avoided

**State Management:**
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use window globals or localStorage for navigation state
- ✅ **DO**: Use Zustand store with persistence middleware

**Animation Performance:**
- ❌ **DON'T**: Animate width/height/color properties directly
- ✅ **DO**: Use transform and opacity with React Spring

**User Experience:**
- ❌ **DON'T**: Create splash screens longer than 3 seconds
- ✅ **DO**: Provide skip functionality and progress feedback

**Chess Theming:**
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use generic loading animations
- ✅ **DO**: Incorporate chess pieces and strategic metaphors

### Scalability Considerations

**Additional Splash Screens:**
The current architecture supports unlimited additional splash screens. Simply:
1. Create new page component in `src/pages/splash/`
2. Create wrapper component in `src/components/`
3. Add action hook in `src/hooks/`
4. Update `PAGE_ACTIONS` constants
5. Add action mapping in `ActionSheetContainer`

**Theme Expansion:**
New theme variants automatically work with existing splash screens due to CSS custom property integration.

**Mobile App Integration:**
All splash screens are designed mobile-first and can be directly ported to React Native with minimal modifications.

## Conclusion

We have successfully built a comprehensive, chess-themed splash screen system that demonstrates modern UX standards while maintaining professional polish. The four implemented examples provide a solid foundation for understanding different approaches to loading screen design, from minimal elegance to full brand experience.

The integration with our existing navigation architecture ensures consistent user experience, while the React Spring integration provides smooth, physics-based animations that feel natural and professional. The system is fully theme-compatible, responsive, and accessible.

This implementation serves as both a functional feature and a learning platform for advanced React animation techniques, providing clear examples of how to build sophisticated loading experiences that enhance rather than distract from the user's journey into the application.

The next phase of implementation should focus on bringing these placeholder pages to life with the detailed specifications outlined above, starting with the Minimal Design as the foundation example and progressing through increasing complexity to the full Branded Design experience.
