## 🔧 CRITICAL CONFIGURATION CHANGES

### React StrictMode Configuration
**File:** `src/main.tsx`
```typescript
// CRITICAL: StrictMode disabled for worker compatibility
createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  // Temporarily disable StrictMode for Stockfish worker compatibility
  // <StrictMode>
    <App />
  // </StrictMode>,
)
```
**Reason:** React StrictMode causes double-mounting in development, which destroys workers before they can initialize.

### Worker Creation Pattern
**File:** `src/services/StockfishService.ts`
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Use classic worker (not ES module) for importScripts support
this.stockfish = new Worker(workerUrl); // NOT { type: 'module' }
```
**Reason:** ES module workers don't support `importScripts()`, which Stockfish.js requires.

### UCI Initialization Sequence
**File:** `src/services/StockfishService.ts`
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Two-stage initialization
// Stage 1: Wait for uciok before sending isready
this.sendCommand('uci', false);
this.pendingCommands.set('uci_init', (response: string) => {
  if (response === 'uciok') {
    setTimeout(checkReadiness, 100); // Stage 2: Send isready
  }
});
```
**Reason:** Stockfish needs full UCI protocol initialization before accepting readiness checks.

### Stockfish Module Integration
**File:** `src/stockfish-worker.js`
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Work with existing Module pattern, not create new engine wrapper
// Override Module.print to capture UCI output
self.Module.print = function(stdout) {
  self.postMessage(stdout); // Forward UCI responses
  if (originalPrint) originalPrint(stdout);
};
```
**Reason:** The stockfish.js file is already a complete worker with built-in Module system.

## 🎓 CRITICAL LESSONS LEARNED

### 1. **Stockfish Build Architecture**
- **Discovery:** The `/stockfish/stockfish.js` is already a complete Emscripten-compiled worker
- **Key Insight:** Don't try to wrap it - work WITH the existing Module pattern
- **Impact:** Wasted hours trying to create custom engine wrappers

### 2. **React StrictMode vs Workers**
- **Discovery:** StrictMode double-mounts components in development, destroying workers
- **Key Insight:** Workers have external lifecycle that conflicts with React's mounting behavior
- **Impact:** Button stayed disabled due to premature worker cleanup

### 3. **ES Module vs Classic Workers**
- **Discovery:** `{ type: 'module' }` workers cannot use `importScripts()`
- **Key Insight:** Stockfish.js requires importScripts to load the engine
- **Impact:** "Module scripts don't support importScripts" error blocked initialization

### 4. **UCI Protocol Timing**
- **Discovery:** Cannot send `isready` immediately after `uci`
- **Key Insight:** Must wait for `uciok` response before checking readiness
- **Impact:** Timeout errors on `isready` command due to race condition

### 5. **Web Worker Debugging Strategy**
- **Discovery:** Worker errors often fail silently
- **Key Insight:** Need comprehensive logging system that reports back to main thread
- **Impact:** Added structured message system for debugging visibility

### 6. **Vite Development vs Production**
- **Discovery:** Worker paths resolve differently in dev vs build
- **Key Insight:** Use `new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url)` pattern for Vite
- **Impact:** Consistent worker loading across environments

### 7. **Worker Initialization State Management**
- **Discovery:** Worker state transitions create command queuing deadlocks
- **Key Insight:** Allow critical commands (`isready`) during initialization state
- **Impact:** Fixed timeout errors by enabling UCI handshake during worker initialization

### 8. **Chess Game State vs Move Data Architecture**
- **Discovery:** `onMove` callbacks typically receive only move data, not complete game state
- **Key Insight:** Chess engines need position (FEN) after move, not just the move itself
- **Impact:** Extended move callback to include game state and FEN for engine analysis

### 9. **React Callback Enhancement Pattern**
- **Discovery:** Standard interfaces may lack data needed for advanced features
- **Key Insight:** Enhance callback data at the hook level rather than component level
- **Impact:** Non-breaking enhancement that maintains API compatibility while adding functionality

### 10. **UCI Protocol vs Chess Position Representation**
- **Discovery:** Multiple ways to represent chess positions (FEN, UCI moves, PGN)
- **Key Insight:** FEN provides complete position state, UCI moves require position tracking
- **Impact:** Using FEN ensures engine gets accurate position regardless of move history

### 11. **Vite HMR vs Web Worker Lifecycle Conflicts**
- **Discovery:** Hot Module Replacement destroys React components while orphaning Web Worker listeners
- **Key Insight:** Workers need singleton pattern in dev, normal lifecycle in production
- **Impact:** Implemented HMR-aware service management preventing "stops after 6 moves" issue

### 12. **React Effect Dependencies and Stale Closures**
- **Discovery:** Derived/computed values in effect dependencies create stale closures
- **Key Insight:** Reactive state that increments after actions provides stable triggers
- **Impact:** Replaced computed ply with reactive state to prevent effect from getting stuck

### 13. **Two-Layer Single-Flight Protection Patterns**
- **Discovery:** React effects can double-trigger even with async state updates
- **Key Insight:** Need protection at both app-level (chess position) and service-level (UCI commands)
- **Impact:** Bulletproofs against duplicate computer move requests causing "Invalid move" errors

### 14. **Atomic Handler Management in Async Services**
- **Discovery:** Handler race conditions cause intermittent move losses in production
- **Key Insight:** Atomic handler updates with verification prevent null-handler invocations
- **Impact:** Eliminated subtle but critical handler drops that stopped computer play eventually

### 15. **Chess Piece Set Asset Management & Dynamic Variants**
- **Discovery:** Piece sets with knight variants (-left, -right) failed to load due to position-based logic flaws
- **Key Insight:** Piece orientation should be determined by current position with intelligent fallbacks, not fixed IDs
- **Impact:** Fixed knight loading across all piece sets using position-aware variant selection

---

## 🏆 ISSUES RESOLVED - FINAL SOLUTIONS APPLIED

### ✅ **Issue #1: Worker Initialization Deadlock**
**Root Cause:** Command queuing prevented `isready` from being sent during initialization state
**Solution Applied:**
```typescript
// Allow isready command during initialization (needed for two-stage init)
if (this.workerState === 'ready' || (this.workerState === 'initializing' && command === 'isready')) {
  this.stockfish.postMessage(command);
}
```
**Result:** UCI handshake completes successfully, button becomes enabled

### ✅ **Issue #2: Missing FEN Position Data**  
**Root Cause:** `onMove` callback only provided move data, not complete game state with FEN
**Solution Applied:**
```typescript
// Enhanced move callback with game state
onMoveCallback({
  ...result.move,
  fen: result.gameState.fen,
  gameState: result.gameState
});
```
**Result:** Stockfish receives correct position after each move, makes appropriate responses

### ✅ **Issue #3: React StrictMode Worker Lifecycle**
**Root Cause:** StrictMode double-mounting destroyed workers before initialization  
**Solution Applied:**
```typescript
// Temporarily disable StrictMode for worker compatibility
// <StrictMode>
  <App />
// </StrictMode>
```
**Result:** Single worker initialization, stable lifecycle management

### ✅ **Issue #4: ES Module vs Classic Worker Compatibility**
**Root Cause:** ES module workers don't support `importScripts()` required by Stockfish
**Solution Applied:**
```typescript
// Use classic worker (not ES module) for importScripts support
this.stockfish = new Worker(workerUrl); // NOT { type: 'module' }
```
**Result:** Stockfish loads successfully without importScripts errors

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED - Computer Stops Playing Mid-Game

### **Problem Description**
After successful implementation of all 6 phases, a new critical issue emerged: **Computer opponent stops making moves after 6-7 moves** in a game. The computer makes moves successfully initially (e7-e5, g8-f6, b8-c6, f8-c5, c6-d4, c5-d6) but then becomes unresponsive even though:

- Stockfish returns valid `bestmove` responses (e.g., `bestmove e8g8 ponder c3b5`)
- All system components report ready state (`stockfishReady: true`, `hasGameState: true`, `hasMakeMoveRef: true`)
- No visible errors in console logs
- Service appears functional but moves are not executed

### **Prime Suspects & Possible Solutions**

#### **1. Promise Resolution Deadlock (HIGHEST PROBABILITY)**
**Symptoms:** `go movetime` command promise hangs indefinitely after 6th move
**Root Cause:** The `sendCommand` promise for `bestmove` response never resolves, leaving `isThinking: true` and blocking all future moves

**Potential Issues:**
- Command queue conflicts - multiple pending 'bestmove' commands overwriting each other
- Message handler race condition - `bestmove` response processed but promise not resolved
- Timeout mechanism failing - promises remain pending beyond 15-second limit

**Debugging Solutions:**
```typescript
// Add comprehensive promise tracking in sendCommand
console.log(`🔍 [STOCKFISH] Command '${command}' registered with key '${commandType}'`);
console.log(`📊 [STOCKFISH] Pending commands:`, Array.from(this.pendingCommands.keys()));

// Add timeout logging
setTimeout(() => {
  if (this.pendingCommands.has(commandType)) {
    console.error(`⏰ [STOCKFISH] TIMEOUT: Command '${command}' never resolved`);
    console.error(`🔍 [STOCKFISH] Final pending commands:`, Array.from(this.pendingCommands.keys()));
  }
}, 15000);
```

#### **2. React State Synchronization Issue (HIGH PROBABILITY)**
**Symptoms:** Computer move logic stops triggering despite correct game state
**Root Cause:** React `useEffect` dependencies become stale, preventing computer move triggering

**Potential Issues:**
- `gameStateRef.current` updates not triggering effect re-evaluation
- `isThinking` state persists as `true`, blocking new move requests
- Computer move effect dependencies array missing critical triggers

**Debugging Solutions:**
```typescript
// Add comprehensive effect logging in App.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('🔄 [COMPUTER_EFFECT] Effect triggered:', {
    vsComputer,
    stockfishReady,
    isThinking,
    gameState: gameStateRef.current?.notation,
    gameStateColor: gameStateRef.current?.piece?.color,
    computerColor,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
}, [vsComputer, stockfishReady, gameStateRef.current, computerColor, isThinking]);

// Force effect re-trigger with game move counter
const [gameMoveCount, setGameMoveCount] = useState(0);
const handleMove = (move: ChessMove) => {
  setGameMoveCount(prev => prev + 1); // Force effect dependency change
  // ... existing logic
};
```

#### **3. UCI Protocol State Corruption (MEDIUM PROBABILITY)**
**Symptoms:** Stockfish accepts commands but responses don't match expected format
**Root Cause:** Engine internal state becomes corrupted after extended gameplay

**Potential Issues:**
- Position FEN string becomes invalid after multiple moves
- Stockfish engine crashes silently and restarts without notification
- UCI command sequence gets out of sync (position → go → bestmove)

**Debugging Solutions:**
```typescript
// Add FEN validation before each move request
public async getBestMove(fen: string, skillLevel: number = 8, timeLimit: number = 1000): Promise<string | null> {
  // Validate FEN format before sending
  if (!this.isValidFEN(fen)) {
    console.error('❌ [STOCKFISH] Invalid FEN provided:', fen);
    return null;
  }
  
  console.log('♟️  [STOCKFISH] Position FEN:', fen);
  console.log('🎯 [STOCKFISH] Skill Level:', skillLevel, 'Time Limit:', timeLimit);
  
  // ... existing logic
}

private isValidFEN(fen: string): boolean {
  // Basic FEN validation regex
  return /^[rnbqkpRNBQKP1-8]+\/[rnbqkpRNBQKP1-8]+\/[rnbqkpRNBQKP1-8]+\/[rnbqkpRNBQKP1-8]+\/[rnbqkpRNBQKP1-8]+\/[rnbqkpRNBQKP1-8]+\/[rnbqkpRNBQKP1-8]+\/[rnbqkpRNBQKP1-8]+ [wb] [KQkq-] [a-h1-8-] \d+ \d+$/.test(fen);
}
```

#### **4. Web Worker Memory/Resource Exhaustion (LOW PROBABILITY)**
**Symptoms:** Worker becomes unresponsive after processing multiple positions
**Root Cause:** Stockfish WASM module runs out of memory or hits performance limits

**Potential Issues:**
- Memory leak in Stockfish WASM after extended analysis
- Browser worker thread becomes unresponsive
- Hash table or transposition table becomes corrupted

**Debugging Solutions:**
```typescript
// Add worker health checks
private async checkWorkerHealth(): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    const startTime = Date.now();
    await this.sendCommand('isready', true);
    const responseTime = Date.now() - startTime;
    
    console.log(`💓 [STOCKFISH] Health check: ${responseTime}ms`);
    return responseTime < 1000; // Healthy if responds within 1 second
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('💀 [STOCKFISH] Worker health check failed:', error);
    return false;
  }
}

// Add worker restart capability
public async restartWorker(): Promise<void> {
  console.log('🔄 [STOCKFISH] Restarting worker due to health issues');
  this.destroy();
  this.initializeEngine();
}
```

### **Immediate Debugging Protocol**

1. **Enable Verbose Promise Logging** - Track all `sendCommand` calls and their resolution status
2. **Add Move Counter Dependencies** - Force React effect re-evaluation with explicit counters
3. **Implement Health Checks** - Verify worker responsiveness before each move request
4. **Add FEN Validation** - Ensure position data integrity throughout the game
5. **Create Worker Recovery** - Automatic restart mechanism if worker becomes unresponsive

### **Expected Resolution Timeline**
- **Phase A (15 mins):** Implement verbose logging to identify exact failure point
- **Phase B (15 mins):** Test prime suspect #1 (Promise Deadlock) with timeout debugging
- **Phase C (15 mins):** Test prime suspect #2 (React State) with effect dependency fixes
- **Phase D (15 mins):** Implement fallback solutions and recovery mechanisms

### **🔬 RESOLUTION TRACKING**

**Current Status:** INVESTIGATING - Prime suspects identified, debugging protocol ready for execution.

**Lessons Learned (RESOLVED):**
```
🎯 ROOT CAUSE: Vite Hot Module Replacement (HMR) Lifecycle Conflicts

The computer stops playing because Vite HMR destroys and recreates React components during 
development, orphaning Web Worker event listeners and clearing Stockfish's internal 
position state. After HMR cycles:
- Worker exists but new React components aren't subscribed to its messages
- Stockfish internal position is reset, so "go movetime" commands use stale/empty positions
- Promise callbacks become stale, preventing bestmove responses from reaching components

🔧 ACTUAL SOLUTION: Singleton Pattern + Position Resyncing

1. **Stockfish Singleton Service**: Created module-level singleton that survives HMR
   - Worker instance persists across component remounts
   - Only destroyed in production, kept alive during development
   - Uses `import.meta.hot` for proper HMR lifecycle management

2. **Handler Rebinding**: Always rebind event handlers on component mount
   - Fresh callbacks on every mount ensure proper React state updates
   - Prevents orphaned listeners from previous component instances

3. **Position Resyncing**: Always send full position before "go" commands
   - `ucinewgame` + `position fen` before every move request
   - Eliminates dependency on worker's internal position memory
   - Bulletproofs against HMR state resets

💡 KEY INSIGHT: Development vs Production Worker Lifecycle Management

Web Workers in React/Vite need different lifecycle strategies for dev vs prod:
- **Development**: Keep workers alive across HMR, rebind handlers only
- **Production**: Normal creation/destruction with component lifecycle
- **Critical**: Always resync position state - never assume worker memory persistence

⚠️  PREVENTION: HMR-Aware Patterns for Stateful Web Workers

- Use singleton patterns for long-lived workers in development
- Always rebind event handlers/callbacks on component mount
- Never rely on worker internal state across component remounts
- Guard cleanup with environment checks: `if (import.meta.env.PROD)`
- Implement state resyncing before critical operations

📈 IMPACT: Robust Development Experience + Production Reliability

- Eliminates mysterious "stops working after a few moves" issues
- Enables seamless hot-reload during chess engine development  
- Provides template for other stateful worker integrations
- Maintains production performance with dev-only safety measures
```

**Testing Evidence Completed:**
- [x] ✅ **Issue Reproduced**: Computer consistently stopped after 6-7 moves during HMR cycles
- [x] ✅ **Root Cause Identified**: Vite HMR lifecycle destroying React tree while orphaning worker
- [x] ✅ **Prime Suspect Confirmed**: #1 (Promise Resolution Deadlock) caused by HMR, not engine
- [x] ✅ **Solution Implemented**: Singleton pattern + handler rebinding + position resyncing
- [x] ✅ **Fix Verified**: Computer continues playing seamlessly across HMR cycles
- [x] ✅ **Prevention Documented**: HMR-aware patterns for stateful Web Workers established

**Implementation Files:**
- `src/services/stockfish-singleton.ts` - HMR-safe singleton service
- `src/services/StockfishService.ts` - Handler management + position resyncing
- `src/hooks/useStockfish.ts` - Dev/prod lifecycle + handler rebinding

## 🔄 SECONDARY ISSUE DISCOVERED & RESOLVED

### **Problem Description**
After resolving the HMR issue, a secondary problem emerged: **Computer Move Effect Double-Triggering**. The computer would attempt to play the same move twice in sequence, causing `Invalid move` errors and breaking the game flow.

**Root Cause:** React effect dependencies triggered the computer move logic both:
1. After human moves (correct) ✅
2. After computer's own moves (incorrect) ❌

**Symptoms:**
- Computer plays move successfully (e.g., e7-e5)
- Immediately tries to play the same move again
- `❌ [CHESS_GAME] Move failed: Invalid move: {"from":"e7","to":"e5"}`
- Game becomes unplayable

### **Solution: Two-Layer Single-Flight Protection**

**Root Cause Analysis:** React effect fired twice with same game state, launching two concurrent `go movetime` commands for identical positions. The issue was:
- Effect dependencies based on React state (not chess state)
- No protection against duplicate launches at source of truth
- `isThinking` state updates are asynchronous, so both effects see `false`

**Implementation - Layer 1: App-Level Ply Latch**
```typescript
// Block multiple searches for the same chess position (ply)
const lastRequestedPlyRef = useRef<number | null>(null);
const inFlightForPlyRef = useRef<number | null>(null);

useEffect(() => {
  const ply = calculateCurrentPly(gameState);
  
  // Single-flight guard at chess level
  if (inFlightForPlyRef.current === ply) {
    console.log('🚫 Already searching for ply', ply, '- blocking duplicate');
    return;
  }
  
  // Latch on this ply
  inFlightForPlyRef.current = ply;
  
  // Async search with proper latch release
  (async () => {
    try {
      const move = await requestMove(fen, timeLimit);
      await applyMove(move);
    } finally {
      // Only release when ply actually changes (move applied)
      queueMicrotask(() => {
        const newPly = calculateCurrentPly(gameState);
        if (newPly !== ply) {
          inFlightForPlyRef.current = null; // Release latch
        }
      });
    }
  })();
}, [shouldComputerMove, stockfishReady, turn, currentPly]); // Chess-state deps
```

**Implementation - Layer 2: Service-Level Single-Flight**
```typescript
// StockfishService - only one 'go' command at a time
private currentSearch?: Promise<string>;

private async goSingleFlight(opts: { movetime: number }): Promise<string> {
  if (this.currentSearch) {
    console.log('🔄 Search in progress - returning existing promise');
    return this.currentSearch; // Dedupe at service level
  }

  this.currentSearch = new Promise((resolve) => {
    this.onBestmove = resolve; // Will be called when bestmove received
    this.stockfish.postMessage(`go movetime ${opts.movetime}`);
  });

  try {
    return await this.currentSearch;
  } finally {
    this.currentSearch = undefined; // Clean up
  }
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.tsx` - Ply-based latch, chess-state dependencies, async search pattern
- `src/services/StockfishService.ts` - Service-level single-flight protection
- `src/hooks/useStockfish.ts` - Simplified (service handles duplicates)

**Result:** **Zero duplicate `go` commands** - blocked at both chess logic level and service level.

## 🔄 TERTIARY ISSUE DISCOVERED & RESOLVED

### **Problem Description**
After resolving both HMR and double-trigger issues, a subtle but critical third issue emerged: **Stale Ply Signals & Handler Race Conditions**. The system still had intermittent failures where the computer would eventually stop playing due to:

1. **Stale Ply Calculation** - Effect stuck at ply 1 due to closure issues
2. **Intermittent Handler Drops** - Moves lost due to handler race conditions

**Root Cause Analysis:** The user provided brilliant feedback identifying two remaining bugs:
- Ply signal derived from game state remained stuck at 1 (stale closure)
- Handler management had race conditions causing occasional move losses

### **Final Solution: Reactive Ply State + Atomic Handlers**

**Implementation - Part A: Reactive Ply Counter (App.tsx)**
```typescript
// Replace computed ply with reactive state
const [ply, setPly] = useState<number>(0);

// Increment after each move actually applies to board
const handleMove = (move: ChessMove) => {
  gameStateRef.current = move;
  
  // Reactive ply increment after human move
  setPly(prev => {
    const newPly = prev + 1;
    console.log('📈 [PLY] Human move applied - ply incremented:', prev, '→', newPly);
    return newPly;
  });
};

// Computer move success also increments ply
const success = await makeMoveRef.current(fromSquare, toSquare);
if (success) {
  setPly(prev => {
    const newPly = prev + 1;
    console.log('📈 [PLY] Computer move applied - ply incremented:', prev, '→', newPly);
    return newPly;
  });
}

// Effect driven by reactive ply state
useEffect(() => {
  // Ply-based single-flight guard
  if (inFlightForPlyRef.current === ply) {
    console.log('🚫 [COMPUTER] Already searching for ply', ply, '- blocking duplicate');
    return;
  }
  
  // Launch computer move for this ply
  inFlightForPlyRef.current = ply;
  // ... move logic
  
}, [shouldComputerMove, stockfishReady, ply]); // Reactive ply dependency
```

**Implementation - Part B: Atomic Handler Management (StockfishService.ts)**
```typescript
// Atomic handler updates with verification
public setHandlers(handlers: StockfishHandlers): void {
  console.log('🔗 [STOCKFISH] Setting/updating handlers atomically');
  this.handlers = { ...handlers };
  
  // Verify handlers are properly set
  console.log('🔍 [STOCKFISH] Handler verification:', {
    onBestMove: !!this.handlers.onBestMove,
    onInfo: !!this.handlers.onInfo,
    onError: !!this.handlers.onError
  });
}

// Atomic handler invocation with null checks
const move = match[1];
console.log('🎯 [STOCKFISH] About to invoke onBestMove handler:', !!this.handlers.onBestMove);
if (this.handlers.onBestMove) {
  this.handlers.onBestMove(move);
  console.log('✅ [STOCKFISH] onBestMove handler invoked successfully');
} else {
  console.warn('⚠️ [STOCKFISH] onBestMove handler missing at invocation time');
}
```

**Implementation - Part C: Robust Promise Handling**
```typescript
// Enhanced single-flight with timeout protection
private async goSingleFlight(opts: { movetime: number }): Promise<string> {
  if (this.currentSearch) {
    return this.currentSearch.promise;
  }

  this.currentSearch = {} as any;
  this.currentSearch.promise = new Promise<string>((resolve, reject) => {
    this.currentSearch!.resolve = resolve;
    this.currentSearch!.reject = reject;
    
    // Timeout protection (3x movetime + buffer)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.tsx` - Reactive ply state, proper move triggers, simplified latch release
- `src/services/StockfishService.ts` - Atomic handlers, timeout protection, proper cleanup
- Effect dependencies: `[shouldComputerMove, stockfishReady, ply]` (minimal, stable)

**Results:**
- ✅ **Stale Ply Fixed** - Reactive state advances correctly with each move
- ✅ **Handler Drops Eliminated** - Atomic management prevents race conditions  
- ✅ **Timeout Protection** - Promises can't hang indefinitely
- ✅ **Clean State Management** - Proper cleanup in all code paths

**Critical Insight:** The issue wasn't the chess logic or Web Worker - it was **React state management patterns**. Using derived/computed values for effect dependencies creates stale closures. **Reactive state that increments after actions complete** provides stable, advancing triggers for effects.

## 🎨 QUATERNARY ISSUE DISCOVERED & RESOLVED

### **Problem Description**
After resolving all Web Worker and React state issues, a UI asset loading problem emerged: **Piece Sets with Knight Variants Not Loading**. The user reported that piece sets (conqueror, executive, modern, tournament) that have `-left` and `-right` knight variants were failing to display knights properly.

**Root Cause Analysis:** The knight orientation logic was flawed:
- Only worked for knights on their exact starting squares (b1, g1, b8, g8)
- Knights that moved to other squares had no variant logic
- Once knights moved off starting files, they fell back to non-existent standard `wN.svg` files

**Symptoms:**
- Knight pieces missing/broken in conqueror, executive, modern, tournament sets
- Only classic set worked (has standard `wN.svg`, no variants)
- Knights appeared correctly only on b-file and g-file positions

### **Final Solution: Position-Aware Variant Selection**

**Implementation - Intelligent Knight Orientation (Piece.tsx)**
```typescript
if (hasKnightVariants) {
  // Strategy: Use current position with intelligent fallbacks
  
  // Primary: Check if knight is on starting files (b or g files)
  const isOnQueenside = piece.position.file === 'b';
  const isOnKingside = piece.position.file === 'g';
  
  if (isOnQueenside) {
    return `/pieces/${pieceSet}/${colorPrefix}N-left.svg`;
  } else if (isOnKingside) {
    return `/pieces/${pieceSet}/${colorPrefix}N-right.svg`;
  }
  
  // Fallback for knights that have moved off their starting files:
  // Use position to determine which orientation looks better
  // Left half of board (a,b,c,d) = left knight, right half (e,f,g,h) = right knight
  const fileIndex = piece.position.file.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
  const useLeftVariant = fileIndex < 4; // Files a,b,c,d
  
  if (useLeftVariant) {
    return `/pieces/${pieceSet}/${colorPrefix}N-left.svg`;
  } else {
    return `/pieces/${pieceSet}/${colorPrefix}N-right.svg`;
  }
}
```

**Key Improvements:**
- **Primary Logic**: Knights on b-file → left variant, g-file → right variant (preserves starting orientation)
- **Fallback Logic**: Left half of board (a,b,c,d) → left variant, right half (e,f,g,h) → right variant
- **Universal Coverage**: Every knight on every square gets appropriate variant
- **Visual Consistency**: Knight orientation matches board position aesthetically

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/chessboard/Piece.tsx` - Enhanced knight variant selection logic

**Results:**
- ✅ **All Piece Sets Work** - Conqueror, executive, modern, tournament knights load correctly
- ✅ **Dynamic Orientation** - Knights maintain appropriate facing throughout gameplay
- ✅ **Fallback Coverage** - No missing pieces regardless of knight movement
- ✅ **Visual Coherence** - Left-facing knights on left side, right-facing on right side

**Critical Insight:** Asset management for dynamic piece variants requires **position-aware logic with comprehensive fallbacks**. Simply checking starting squares fails once pieces move. The solution needs to handle **every possible square** with aesthetically appropriate orientation.
