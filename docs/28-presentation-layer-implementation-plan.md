**Objective**: Establish clean project foundation with proper dependencies and type definitions

#### Dependencies to Install:
```bash
npm install zustand lucide-react
npm install -D @types/react @types/react-dom
```

#### Files Created:
- `src/components/layout/types.ts` - Core type definitions for navigation
- `src/components/layout/index.ts` - Layout component exports
- `src/components/index.ts` - Global component exports
- `src/pages/index.ts` - Page component exports
- `src/providers/index.ts` - Provider exports

#### Key Type Definitions:
Create `src/components/layout/types.ts` with TabId type for navigation system.

#### Integration Points:
- `src/main.tsx` - Entry point integration
- `package.json` - Dependency management
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

## Phase 2: Core Layout Components

### 2.1 Flexbox Layout Architecture
**Objective**: Implement proper flexbox layout container with semantic HTML structure

- `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Application header with crown icon
- `src/components/layout/MainContent.tsx` - Main content wrapper
- `src/components/layout/BackgroundEffects.tsx` - Gaming background effects

#### Critical Implementation Patterns:

**Flexbox Layout Structure:**
- Use `flex flex-col h-screen` for full-height vertical container
- Header: `flex-shrink-0` - Takes only needed space, never shrinks
- Main: `flex-1 overflow-auto` - Fills remaining space, scrolls internally
- Footer: `flex-shrink-0` - Takes only needed space, never shrinks
- Content is physically contained within layout boundaries
- No fixed positioning needed - flexbox handles layout naturally

**Semantic HTML Structure:**
- Use `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` within flex container
- Proper z-index hierarchy: Header/Footer (z-20), Main (z-10), Background (default)
- Content cannot go behind header or footer due to flex constraints

#### Critical Implementation Requirements:
1. **No Fixed Positioning**: Use flexbox flow instead of fixed positioning overlays
2. **Semantic Elements**: Proper HTML5 semantic structure throughout
3. **Z-Index Hierarchy**: Consistent layering system across components
4. **Container Constraints**: Content physically constrained within flex boundaries

#### Integration Points:
- `src/App.tsx` - Layout integration and routing setup
- CSS custom properties system for theming
- Background effects positioning and animation

#### Deliverables:
- [x] Flexbox layout container with proper height management
