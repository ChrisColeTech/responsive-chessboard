**Note**: This document should be actively maintained throughout the implementation process. Each phase completion should trigger an update to capture fresh insights and lessons while they're still clear in the team's memory.

## Template for Recording Lessons

When adding lessons learned, use this format:

### Phase X: [Phase Name] Lessons

**Challenge**: Brief description of the challenge faced

**Solution**: How it was resolved

**Insight**: What was learned that applies to future work

**Impact**: How this lesson affected the project timeline/quality/performance

**Recommendation**: What would be done differently next time
