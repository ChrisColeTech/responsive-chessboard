# Casino Enhancement Questions - Document 45.0.2

## Questions for Clarification

While the original document doesn't contain explicit questions, the following areas require clarification during implementation:

### Technical Architecture Questions

1. **Storage Integration**: How should the casino store integrate with the existing `appStore.ts` coin balance? Should it be a complete replacement or complementary system?

2. **Audio Service Integration**: The document mentions using existing `audioService.ts` as base functionality - what specific methods/interfaces should be maintained for compatibility?

3. **Route Integration**: How should casino pages integrate with the existing routing system? Should they be part of the main app or separate PWA experience?

### Performance & Resource Questions

4. **Memory Management**: With a 50MB cache limit and multiple concurrent games, what's the priority order for cache eviction when limits are exceeded?

5. **Battery Optimization**: What specific performance degradation strategies should be implemented when battery level drops below 20%?

6. **Device Performance Tiers**: How should the app gracefully degrade features for "low" performance tier devices?

### Game Logic Questions

7. **RNG Validation**: What testing methodology should be used to validate the cryptographically secure RNG meets gaming fairness standards?

8. **RTP Calculation**: How should Return to Player percentages be calculated and validated across different game types?

9. **Transaction Integrity**: How should offline transactions be validated and synchronized when connectivity is restored?

### User Experience Questions

10. **Installation Prompts**: Should PWA installation prompts be dismissible permanently or re-prompt after additional sessions?

11. **Haptic Feedback Accessibility**: How should haptic patterns be adjusted for users with motion sensitivity or disabilities?

12. **Screen Reader Support**: What specific ARIA labels and descriptions are needed for complex game interactions like card selection?

### Business Logic Questions

13. **Balance Validation**: What should happen when a user attempts to bet more than their available balance? Auto-reduce bet or prevent action entirely?

14. **Session Persistence**: How long should game sessions persist across browser restarts or device sleep?

15. **Progressive Features**: Are there plans for additional casino games beyond the three mentioned (slots, blackjack, video poker)?

### Integration Questions

16. **Chess Theme Consistency**: How should casino game theming align with the existing chess application's visual design system?

17. **Component Reusability**: Which existing components from the chess application can be reused or extended for casino functionality?

18. **Error Handling**: How should casino-specific errors (insufficient balance, network failures, etc.) integrate with existing error handling systems?

### Testing & Validation Questions

19. **Cross-Device Testing**: What specific mobile devices and screen sizes should be prioritized for testing each phase?

20. **Accessibility Testing**: What screen reader software and testing methodologies should be used to validate WCAG 2.1 AA compliance?

21. **Load Testing**: How should the application perform under high-frequency user interactions (rapid betting, quick animations)?

### Security Questions

22. **Local Storage Security**: How should sensitive game data (transaction history, balances) be secured in browser storage?

23. **Offline Security**: What measures prevent manipulation of offline balance data before synchronization?

24. **Audit Trail**: What level of transaction logging is required for potential gaming regulation compliance?

### Future Considerations

25. **Scalability**: How should the architecture accommodate future casino games not yet planned?

26. **Analytics**: What user interaction data should be collected for game optimization and user experience improvement?

27. **Internationalization**: Are there plans to support multiple languages or currencies in the casino functionality?

## Research Questions for Implementation Team

### Phase 1 Questions
- Which specific crypto.getRandomValues() implementation provides the best performance across different browsers?
- What are the optimal audio file formats and compression settings for different mobile browsers?

### Phase 2 Questions  
- How should the mathematical models be validated for different payout configurations?
- What testing framework is best suited for game logic unit testing with random number generation?

### Phase 3 Questions
- Which React Spring animation configurations provide the smoothest experience across different device performance tiers?
- How should animation performance be monitored and adjusted in real-time?

### Phase 4 Questions
- What fallback strategies work best when Web Audio API or Vibration API are not supported?
- How should audio mixing be balanced for users with hearing impairments?

### Phase 5 Questions
- What's the optimal component structure for maximum reusability across different casino games?
- How should touch gestures be tested across different mobile operating systems?

### Phase 6 Questions
- What Zustand store architecture best supports multiple concurrent games without state conflicts?
- How should IndexedDB schema be designed for optimal query performance?

### Phase 7 Questions
- What mobile-specific optimizations provide the greatest performance improvement?
- How should the application handle device orientation changes during gameplay?

### Phase 8-10 Questions
- What's the minimal viable implementation for each game that still provides engaging gameplay?
- How should PWA features be prioritized based on user engagement metrics?

## Implementation Clarification Needed

These questions should be addressed before beginning development of each respective phase to ensure clear requirements and successful implementation.
